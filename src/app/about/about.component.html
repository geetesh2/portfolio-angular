      <p class="about-text">
        I'm <span class="highlight">Geetesh</span>, a passionate Full-Stack Developer who loves building real-world web apps using modern tech and clean code.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I have hands-on experience with Angular, Node.js, Express, and .NET Web APIs, and I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, scalable solutions. I'm also familiar with CI/CD pipelines, cloud services, and testing frameworks like Jest and Cypress.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        What drives me is not just writing code, but solving real problems that help users and businesses. I believe in continuous learning, and I spend my free time exploring new tools, practicing DSA, and improving my system design skills.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Outside of tech, I’m a huge fan of anime (Naruto’s my favorite!) and believe that a ninja’s perseverance applies perfectly to a developer's journey too.
